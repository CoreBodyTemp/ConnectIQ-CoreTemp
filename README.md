# ConnectIQ-CoreTemp
ConnectIQ example code for using a sensor that supports the CoreTemp ANT+ profile

This is full sample code minus alerts - so the code size is a bit large which can be reduced.

CoreSensor.mc  - code needed to conect and communicate with a CoreTemp ANT+ profile device (such as CORE)
CoreFitContributions.mc - code for writing the FIT core_temperature values as described in the FIT SDK and other fields as recomened naming

This version has both on screen field editing and with the phone app
